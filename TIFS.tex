            Extension of Conference Paper: a preliminary version of this article entitled ``Cracking Android Pattern Lock
            in Five Attempts" by G. Ye, Z. Tang, D. Fang, X. Chen, K. Kim, B. Taylor and Z. Wang appeared in
            The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2017~\cite{ye2017cracking}.
            The extended version makes the following several additional contributions over the conference
            paper, providing new insights to the original paper:


            (1)	It quantifies the strength of locking patterns using the guessing probability, showing that traditional approaches for quantifying the pattern lock security is unreliable under video-side channel attacks (section~\ref{section: pattern-complexity-classification});


            (2)	It provides new evaluations to understand the impact of the screen size and the camera model on the success of the attack (section~\ref{section: screen-size and cameras});


            (3)	It extends the attacking method to break PIN-based passwords, demonstrating the applicability of the attack on PIN-based passwords (section~\ref{section: attacking-pin-passwords});


            (4)	It includes a limited study to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack, where the video footage only captures the fingertip (section~\ref{section: limited-study});


            (5)	It proposes a simple, yet effective countermeasure. By making some small modifications to the way a pattern lock is generated, the success rate of the attack will drop significantly (section~\ref{section: potential-remedy});


            (6)	It extends the related work to discuss some of the recent studies on the security of Android pattern lock (section~\ref{section: relate-work}).
